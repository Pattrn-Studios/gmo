## 1. Welcome

The GMO (Global Market Outlook) platform is a report-building tool that lets you create professional, interactive financial reports for web and print. Instead of building reports manually in PowerPoint, you use a structured editor with built-in tools that help you:

- Build charts automatically from your data files
- Recreate charts from existing images
- Generate written content using AI
- Publish reports to the web instantly
- Translate reports into French automatically
- Export to PowerPoint and PDF when needed

This guide walks you through every step, from opening the editor to sharing your finished report.

---

## 2. Getting Started

### Opening the Editor

1. Open your web browser and go to **https://gmo-prototype.sanity.studio**
2. Sign in with your account credentials
3. You will see the main dashboard with a list of existing reports on the left-hand side

### What You'll See

The editor is split into two main areas:

- **Left panel** — A list of all reports in the system. Click any report to open it.
- **Main area** — The editing form where you create and modify your report content.

At the top of the editing area, you'll find a toolbar with action buttons. These become important later when you're ready to publish, view, translate, or export your report.

---

## 3. Creating a New Report

### Step 1: Start a New Report

1. In the left panel, click the **"+"** button or **"Create new"** to start a new report
2. Select **"Report"** as the document type

### Step 2: Fill in the Report Details

You'll see the following fields at the top of the editor:

**Report Title** (required)
- Enter the title of your report, for example: *"Global Market Outlook — January 2026"*
- Maximum 200 characters

**URL Slug**
- This is generated automatically from your title — you don't need to change it
- It creates a web-friendly version of your title for the report's web address

**Publication Date** (required)
- Select the date this report should be published
- Defaults to today's date

**Author**
- Enter the author name
- Defaults to "AXA Investment Managers"

**Status**
- Choose the current stage of your report:
  - **Draft** — Work in progress
  - **Review** — Ready for review by others
  - **Approved** — Approved and ready to publish
  - **Published** — Live and visible to readers

**Cover Image** (optional)
- Upload an image to use as the report's cover
- You can adjust the focal point of the image using the hotspot editor (see [Uploading Images](#13-uploading-images))

**Executive Summary** (optional)
- Write a brief overview of the report (2–3 sentences)

### Step 3: Add Your Sections

Below the report details, you'll see the **Report Sections** area. This is where you build the body of your report by adding different types of sections. Click **"Add item"** to add your first section.

> **Tip:** A typical report follows this order:
> 1. Title Section (cover)
> 2. Navigation Section (table of contents)
> 3. Header Section (section divider)
> 4. Content Sections and Chart Insights Sections (your main content)
> 5. Timeline Section (if applicable)

---

## 4. Understanding Section Types

When you click **"Add item"** in the Report Sections area, you can choose from six section types. Here's what each one does:

| Section Type | Icon | What It's For |
|-------------|------|---------------|
| **Title Section** | 📰 | The cover page of your report — includes a main heading, optional subheading, background, and logo |
| **Navigation Section** | 🗂️ | A table of contents that lists all sections in your report |
| **Header Section** | 🎯 | A coloured divider that separates major parts of your report |
| **Content Section** | — | The main workhorse — displays text, images, and charts in flexible layouts |
| **Chart Insights Section** | 📈 | A chart paired with a coloured insights panel highlighting key takeaways |
| **Timeline Section** | 📅 | A horizontal timeline showing 3–6 events or milestones |

The following chapters walk through each section type in detail.

---

---

## 11. Working with Charts

Charts can be added to **Content Sections** and **Chart Insights Sections**. There are two ways to create a chart: from a data file (spreadsheet) or from an existing chart image.

### Where to Find Chart Controls

When you enable charts in a section, the **Chart Configuration** area shows buttons:

- **Add Chart** — Create a new chart from a spreadsheet
- **Upload Image** — Create a chart from an existing chart image
- **Edit Chart** — Modify an existing chart (appears after a chart has been saved)

**Step 1:** Click **"Add Chart"**

A pop-up window titled **"Chart Builder"** will appear with a file upload area.

**Step 2:** Upload your file

- Drag and drop your file onto the upload area, or click to browse your computer
- Supported formats: Excel (.xlsx, .xls) or CSV (.csv)
- Maximum file size: 10 MB

**Step 3:** Wait for AI analysis

You'll see a loading message: *"Analyzing your data with Claude..."*

The system reads your data and determines the best way to display it as a chart.

**Step 4:** Review the recommendation

The system shows you:

- A **Recommended Chart** with a live preview
- A **"Why this chart?"** explanation box describing why this chart type was chosen for your data
- **Alternative Charts** — 2–3 thumbnail previews of other chart styles that could also work

**Step 5:** Choose your preferred chart

- To keep the recommendation, leave it selected
- To try an alternative, click any of the thumbnail previews at the bottom — it will swap in as the main chart

**Step 6:** Save

Click **"Save Chart"** to apply your selection, or **"Cancel"** to discard.

---

### 11.2 Creating a Chart from an Image

Use this when you have an existing chart (from a PowerPoint, report, or screenshot) that you'd like to recreate.

**Step 1:** Click **"Upload Image"**

A pop-up window titled **"Chart Image Import"** will appear.

**Step 2:** Upload your chart image

- Drag and drop, or click to browse
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, WebP
- Maximum file size: 10 MB

**Step 3:** Wait for AI analysis

You'll see: *"Analyzing chart image with AI..."*

The system examines your image, extracts all the data points, labels, and values, then recreates the chart digitally.

**Step 4:** Review and edit the extracted data

The system shows:

- A **recreated chart** based on what was found in your image
- An **Extracted Data** table below the chart

The data table is fully editable:
- **Click any cell** to correct a value if the AI misread it
- **Click any column header** to rename it — this automatically updates the chart legend
- First column values are left-aligned (these are your categories or dates)
- Number columns are right-aligned

**Step 5:** Choose chart style

- Review the recommended chart
- Click any **Alternative Chart** thumbnail to try a different style

**Step 6:** Save

Click **"Save Chart"** to apply, or **"Cancel"** to discard.

---

### 11.3 Editing an Existing Chart

If you've already saved a chart and want to make changes:

1. Click **"Edit Chart"** in the Chart Configuration area
2. The Chart Builder reopens with your current chart loaded
3. If the chart was created from a spreadsheet, you'll see the chart with alternatives
4. If the chart was created from an image, you'll see the chart with the editable data table
5. Make your changes and click **"Save Chart"**

---

### 11.4 Removing a Chart

To remove a chart from a section:

1. Click **"Remove Chart"** in the Chart Configuration area
2. The chart is removed and the buttons return to **"Add Chart"** and **"Upload Image"**

---

### Supported Chart Types

The system can create the following chart types, and will recommend the best one for your data:

| Chart Type | Best For |
|-----------|----------|
| **Line** | Trends over time |
| **Column** | Comparing values across a small number of categories |
| **Bar** (horizontal) | Comparing values across many categories |

| **Radar** | Comparing multiple variables at once |
| **Waterfall** | Showing cumulative effects of sequential values |
| **Gauge** | Displaying a single metric against a target |
| **Treemap / Heatmap** | Displaying hierarchical or matrix data |

---

## 12. Using AI Content Suggestions

When a chart has been added to a **Content Section** or **Chart Insights Section**, the system can automatically generate written content based on your chart data.

### Where to Find It

A blue card appears at the top of the section:

> **AI Content Assistant**
> Generate title, subtitle, and content based on your chart data
>
> **[Generate Content]**

### Step-by-Step

**Step 1:** Click **"Generate Content"**

A pop-up window titled **"Generate Content with AI"** will appear. Generation starts automatically.

**Step 2:** Wait for suggestions

You'll see: *"Analyzing chart data with AI..."* followed by *"Generating content suggestions"*

**Step 3:** Review the suggestions

The system shows a card for each field it can generate. Depending on your section type, you may see suggestions for:

- **Title** — A section heading based on your chart data
- **Subtitle** — Supporting text
- **Content Bullets** — Key points for the body text
- **Key Insights** — Bullet points for the insights panel (Chart Insights Sections only)

Each suggestion card shows:
- The **current value** (what's currently in the field)
- The **suggested value** (what the AI recommends)
- A **checkbox** to include or exclude the suggestion

All suggestions are selected by default.

**Step 4:** Choose what to accept

- **Untick** any suggestions you don't want to use
- The badge at the top shows how many are selected (e.g., "3 of 4 selected")

**Step 5:** Take action

You have three options:

- **"Accept Selected"** — Applies the ticked suggestions to your section fields and closes the window
- **"Regenerate"** — Discards current suggestions and generates new ones
- **"Decline All"** — Closes the window without making any changes

> **Tip:** Always review AI suggestions before accepting. They're a starting point — you can edit the text further after accepting.

---

## 13. Uploading Images

Several sections allow you to upload images — cover images, section images, card images, timeline images, and logos.

### How to Upload

1. Click the image upload area in the relevant field
2. Either drag and drop an image, or click to browse your computer
3. Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, WebP

### Using the Hotspot Editor

After uploading an image, you can set a **hotspot** — this tells the system which part of the image is most important, so it stays visible when the image is cropped at different screen sizes.

1. After uploading, click the image to open the editor
2. Drag the circular hotspot to the area you want to keep in focus
3. Adjust the crop rectangle if needed
4. Click **"Done"** or close the editor

> **Tip:** Setting a hotspot is especially important for cover images and section images, which may be cropped differently on desktop and mobile screens.

---

## 14. Design Adjustments

You can customise the visual appearance of your report through several design controls built into each section.

### Background Colours

Most section types let you choose a background colour:

| Colour | Hex Code | Available In |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Blue | #7CC5D9 | Content, Header, Chart Insights |
| Green | #008252 | Content, Header, Chart Insights, Title |
| Orange | #E8967B | Content, Header, Chart Insights |
| Brown | #A8887A | Content, Header, Chart Insights |
| Mint | #9DD9C7 | Header |
| Primary Green | #3E7274 | Title |
| Coast Blue | #3D748F | Title |
| Metallic Copper | #AC5359 | Title |
| White | #FFFFFF | Title, Content (default) |

When you choose a coloured background, the text automatically switches to white for readability.

### Chart Layout Options

In Content Sections, you can arrange text and charts in three ways:

- **Chart on Left** — The chart sits on the left, text content on the right
- **Chart on Right** — Text on the left, chart on the right (default)
- **Chart Full Width** — The chart spans the full width, with text above or below

### Insights Panel Position

In Chart Insights Sections, you can place the insights panel:

- **Right** (default) — Alongside the chart on the right
- **Left** — Alongside the chart on the left
- **Top** — Above the chart
- **Bottom** — Below the chart

### Navigation Layout

The Navigation Section offers three display styles:

- **Vertical List** — A simple stacked list of section titles
- **Horizontal Grid** — Section titles arranged in columns
- **Cards** — Visual cards with optional images (most engaging)

---

## 15. Publishing Your Report

### Understanding the Status Workflow

Reports move through four stages:

1. **Draft** — You're still working on it
2. **Review** — It's ready for others to review
3. **Approved** — It's been approved for publication
4. **Published** — It's live and visible to readers

Change the status using the **Status** field at the top of your report.

### How to Publish

1. Set the **Status** field to **"Published"**
2. Click **"Publish"** in the bottom toolbar of the editor

Once published, your report is immediately available at the live report URL. There's no delay — changes appear as soon as you publish.

> **Tip:** You can continue editing a published report. Your changes become visible as soon as you publish them again.

---

## 16. Viewing the Live Report

### From the Editor

1. In the toolbar at the top of your report, click **"View Live Report"** (the globe icon)
2. The report opens in a new browser tab at **https://gmo-report.vercel.app**

### What Readers See

The live report includes several features for readers:

**Navigation**
- A **table of contents** in the left sidebar (on desktop) that highlights the current section as you scroll
- A **progress bar** at the very top showing how far through the report you've read

**Language Switching**
- A **flag icon** in the top-right corner opens a language menu
- Readers can switch between English and French (see next section)

---

## 17. Viewing the French Translation

The platform automatically translates your report from English into French.

### From the Editor

1. Make sure your report is **published** (the translation only works for published reports)
2. In the toolbar, click **"Voir traduction francaise"** (the translate icon)
3. The French version opens in a new browser tab

If the button is greyed out, it means the report hasn't been published yet. Publish your report first, then try again.

### What Readers See

- The French report appears at **https://gmo-report.vercel.app/fr/**
- A brief loading message appears: *"Chargement de la traduction..."* (Loading translation...)
- All text is translated into formal business French
- Charts, numbers, percentages, and proper nouns remain unchanged
- An information banner at the bottom explains this is an automatic translation, with a link back to the English version

### What Gets Translated

- Report title and summary
- All section titles and subtitles
- Body text content
- Chart labels and axis labels
- Key insights
- Timeline item headings and descriptions

### What Stays the Same

- Chart data (numbers)
- Image content
- Dates and percentages
- Proper nouns and abbreviations

> **Tip:** The translation is generated fresh each time someone views the French page. After you update and re-publish content, the French version will automatically reflect your changes.

---

## 18. Exporting to PowerPoint

The platform can generate a branded PowerPoint presentation from your report, with optional AI-powered design review.

### Step 1: Open the Export Window

1. In the toolbar at the top of your report, click **"Export as PowerPoint"** (the download icon)
2. A pop-up window titled **"PowerPoint Export with AI Review"** appears

### Step 2: Generate Slide Previews

You have two options:

- **"Generate Previews"** — Creates preview images of your slides so you can review them before exporting (recommended)
- **"Skip Review & Export"** — Downloads the PowerPoint file immediately without previewing

If you chose **"Generate Previews"**, wait while the system creates slide images. You'll see: *"Generating slide previews..."*

### Step 3: Preview Your Slides

Once previews are ready, you'll see a grid of slide thumbnails. Each slide shows:
- A preview image
- A label indicating its type (Title, Contents, Divider, Chart, Insights, or Timeline)
- A slide number

You can click any slide to select and highlight it.

### Step 4: Get AI Design Review (optional but recommended)

Click **"Get AI Review"** to have the system check your slides for design issues.

You'll see: *"Analyzing slides with AI..."*

### Step 5: Review Suggestions

After the review, you'll see:

**Design Score** — A score out of 100 indicating overall design quality

**Suggestions** — A list of recommendations grouped by importance:

- **High Priority** (red) — Issues that should be fixed before distribution
  - Examples: Title too long (over 80 characters), too many bullet points (6+), placeholder content detected, wrong background colour
- **Medium Priority** (yellow) — Issues worth reviewing
  - Examples: Generic chart title, subtitle too long, source format inconsistent
- **Low Priority** (green) — Minor improvements
  - Examples: Spacing tweaks, font size variations, image resolution

**Strengths** — Things the system found that look good

Each suggestion shows:
- What the issue is
- Which slide it affects (you can click the slide number to see it)
- The current value and what it should be
- A checkbox to select it for future reference

High priority suggestions are automatically selected.

### Step 6: Export

Click **"Export PowerPoint"** to download the file.

The file will be named after your report title (e.g., *"Global Market Outlook — January 2026.pptx"*).

> **Tip:** You don't have to fix suggestions before exporting. The review is informational — it shows you what could be improved, but the export always generates the full presentation.

---

## 19. Exporting to PDF

The platform can generate a branded, print-ready PDF of your report. The PDF export covers the same sections as the PowerPoint export.

### How to Export

1. In the toolbar at the top of your report, click **"Export as PDF"** (the download icon)
2. The button label changes to *"Generating PDF..."* while the file is being created
3. Once ready, the PDF automatically downloads to your computer

### What's Included

The PDF renders all 6 section types from your report:

- **Title page** — Report title, subtitle, and company logo
- **Navigation / Table of Contents** — Numbered list of report sections
- **Header sections** — Full-width divider pages with themed background colours and images
- **Content sections** — Text, charts, and images with colour-themed backgrounds matching your chosen section theme
- **Chart Insights sections** — Chart with an accompanying key insights panel
- **Timeline sections** — Numbered items with images displayed in document order

Charts are rendered as high-resolution images. Section background colours (blue, green, orange, brown, mint) are applied automatically based on your Sanity colour theme selection. Each page includes a branded footer with "BNP PARIBAS ASSET MANAGEMENT" and page numbers.

---

## 20. Tips and Best Practices

### Preparing Data for Charts

- **Clean your data first** — Remove empty rows and columns before uploading
- **Use clear column headers** — The first row should contain descriptive names (e.g., "Year", "Revenue", "Growth Rate")
- **First column = categories** — The leftmost column should contain your categories, dates, or labels
- **Keep it focused** — 3–5 data series work best for readability
- **Use consistent formats** — Don't mix percentages and whole numbers in the same column

### Uploading Chart Images

- **Use high-resolution images** — The clearer the image, the more accurate the data extraction
- **Include visible labels** — Make sure axis labels and data labels are readable
- **Use simple charts** — Complex or heavily decorated charts may not extract cleanly
- **Check the extracted data** — Always review the data table after uploading an image and correct any values that were misread

### Writing Effective Content

- **Use bullet points** rather than long paragraphs — they display better in both web and PowerPoint
- **Keep titles concise** — Under 80 characters for the best PowerPoint output
- **Keep subtitles supporting** — Under 200 characters
- **3–5 bullet points per section** is ideal — more than 5 will trigger a design warning on export
- **Review AI suggestions** — They're a helpful starting point, but always check they accurately reflect your data

### Design Tips

- **Be consistent with colours** — Use the same colour theme for related sections
- **Use Header Sections as dividers** — They create visual breaks between major topics
- **Set image hotspots** — This ensures important parts of images aren't cropped on different screens
- **Check your PowerPoint** — Use the AI Review feature before distributing to catch common design issues

### Publishing Workflow

- **Save frequently** — Your work is saved to the system, but click Publish to make it live
- **Use status fields** — Move from Draft → Review → Approved → Published to track progress
- **Changes are instant** — Once you publish, the live report updates immediately
